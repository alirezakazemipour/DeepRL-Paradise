# DeepRL-Paradise
My old self passionately said: 
> This repository is a comprehensive list of all of my state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning implementations and I have been fortunate to get the chance to write their code form scratch based on my understanding about each and every one of them.  
> Each directory refers you to the corresponding repository that the algorithm has been put together. I would be more than happy to have your thoughts in the _issues_ section of this repository or on the corresponding algorithm's repo.

After reading [Empirical Design in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01315), I say:
> Of all issues that the repos possess, they show some results only for a single seed! ðŸ˜² So don't take the repos very seriously unless you test them for some a handful number of seeds!
