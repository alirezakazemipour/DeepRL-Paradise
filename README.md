# DeepRL-Paradise

This repository is a comprehensive list of my state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning implementations and I have been fortunate to get the chance to write their code form scratch based on my understanding about each and every one of them.  

Each directory refers you to the corresponding repository that the algorithm has been put together. I would be more than happy to have your thoughts in the _issues_ section of this repository or on the corresponding algorithm's repo.
